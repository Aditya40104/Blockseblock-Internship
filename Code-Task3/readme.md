### ðŸ”· Task 3: Consensus Mechanism Simulation

**Objective:**  
Simulate and compare **Proof of Work (PoW)**, **Proof of Stake (PoS)**, and **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)** using simple logic in code.

**ðŸ§© Tasks:**
- Create mock objects for 3 validators:
  - `miner = { power: random value }` â†’ used in PoW
  - `staker = { stake: random value }` â†’ used in PoS
  - `voters = [3 mock accounts voting]` â†’ used in DPoS

**ðŸ”„ Simulate:**
- For **PoW**: Select the validator with the **highest power**.
- For **PoS**: Select the validator with the **highest stake**.
- For **DPoS**: Randomly choose a delegate who received the **most votes**.

**ðŸ’¡ Output:**
- Print the selected validator and the consensus method used.
- Use `console.log()` or `print()` statements to explain how each selection was made.

**ðŸŽ¯ Goal:**  
Understand and compare the **decision-making processes** used in various blockchain consensus mechanisms such as PoW, PoS, and DPoS.
