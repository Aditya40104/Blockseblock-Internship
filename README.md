# Blockseblock-Internship
Mini Task 1: Build & Explain a Simple Blockchain
 Goal:
Understand blockchain fundamentals, block structure, and consensus mechanisms by simulating a mini blockchain and explaining how it works â€” both technically and conceptually.

ðŸ“Œ Task Instructions:
 Theoretical Part:
Blockchain Basics


Define blockchain in your own words (100â€“150 words).


List 2 real-life use cases (e.g., supply chain, digital identity).


Block Anatomy


Draw a block showing: data, previous hash, timestamp, nonce, and Merkle root.


Briefly explain with an example how the Merkle root helps verify data integrity.


Consensus Conceptualization


Explain in brief (4â€“5 sentences each):


What is Proof of Work and why does it require energy?


What is Proof of Stake and how does it differ?


What is Delegated Proof of Stake and how are validators selected?



Practical Part (Code-Based Tasks)
1. Block Simulation in Code
Objective: Build a basic blockchain with 3 linked blocks using code.
 Task:
Create a Block class with:


index, timestamp, data, previousHash, hash, and nonce


Implement a simple hash generator using SHA-256


Link 3 blocks by chaining their previousHash


Display all blocks with their hashes


 Challenge:
Change the data of Block 1 and recalculate its hash.


Observe how all following blocks become invalid unless hashes are recomputed.


 Goal: Understand how tampering one block affects the entire chain.

2.  Nonce Mining Simulation
Objective: Simulate Proof-of-Work by mining a block that satisfies a difficulty condition.
 Task:
Modify your Block class to include a mineBlock(difficulty) function


Set difficulty (e.g., hash must start with "0000")


In mineBlock(), repeatedly increment the nonce until the hash meets the difficulty condition


 Output:
Print how many nonce attempts were needed


Measure time taken using a timer


Goal: Experience how computational effort increases with difficulty

3.  Consensus Mechanism Simulation
Objective: Simulate and compare PoW, PoS, and DPoS logic in code.
 Task:
Create mock objects for 3 validators:


miner = {power: random value} for PoW


staker = {stake: random value} for PoS


voters = [3 mock accounts voting] for DPoS


 Simulate:
For PoW: Select validator with highest power


For PoS: Select validator with highest stake


For DPoS: Randomly choose a delegate based on most votes


 Output:
Print selected validator and consensus method used


Include a console.log explanation of the selection logic


 Goal: Compare decision-making in various consensus mechanisms

Submission Instructions:
Submit a GitHub repo or folder with:


blockchain_simulation.js or .py (3 linked blocks)


mining_simulation.js or .py (nonce task)


consensus_demo.js or .py (PoW, PoS, DPoS logic)


Include brief comments and console logs explaining your output
