# 🧠 Mini Task 1: Build & Explain a Simple Blockchain

## 🎯 Goal:
Understand blockchain fundamentals, block structure, and consensus mechanisms by simulating a mini blockchain and explaining how it works — both technically and conceptually.

---

## 📌 Task Instructions:

### 📖 Theoretical Part:

#### 🔹 Blockchain Basics
- **Define blockchain in your own words (100–150 words).**
- **List 2 real-life use cases (e.g., supply chain, digital identity).**

#### 🔹 Block Anatomy
- **Draw a block showing:**  
  - `data`, `previous hash`, `timestamp`, `nonce`, and `Merkle root`.
- **Briefly explain with an example how the Merkle root helps verify data integrity.**

#### 🔹 Consensus Conceptualization
Explain briefly (4–5 sentences each):

- **What is Proof of Work and why does it require energy?**
- **What is Proof of Stake and how does it differ?**
- **What is Delegated Proof of Stake and how are validators selected?**

### 💻 Practical Part (Code-Based Tasks)

#### 🧩 1. Block Simulation in Code
**Objective**: Build a basic blockchain with 3 linked blocks using code.

**Tasks:**
- Create a `Block` class with:
  - `index`, `timestamp`, `data`, `previousHash`, `hash`, and `nonce`
- Implement a simple hash generator using `SHA-256`
- Link 3 blocks by chaining their `previousHash`
- Display all blocks with their hashes

**Challenge**:
- Change the data of Block 1 and recalculate its hash.
- Observe how all following blocks become invalid unless hashes are recomputed.

**Goal**: Understand how tampering one block affects the entire chain.

#### ⛏️ 2. Nonce Mining Simulation

**Objective**: Simulate Proof-of-Work by mining a block that satisfies a difficulty condition.

**Tasks:**
- Modify your `Block` class to include a `mineBlock(difficulty)` function
- Set `difficulty` (e.g., hash must start with `"0000"`)
- In `mineBlock()`, repeatedly increment the `nonce` until the hash meets the difficulty condition

**Output:**
- Print how many nonce attempts were needed
- Measure time taken using a timer

**Goal**: Experience how computational effort increases with difficulty

---

#### ⚖️ 3. Consensus Mechanism Simulation

**Objective**: Simulate and compare PoW, PoS, and DPoS logic in code.

**Tasks:**
- Create mock objects for 3 validators:
  - `miner = {power: random value}` for PoW
  - `staker = {stake: random value}` for PoS
  - `voters = [3 mock accounts voting]` for DPoS

**Simulate:**
- For **PoW**: Select validator with highest power
- For **PoS**: Select validator with highest stake
- For **DPoS**: Randomly choose a delegate based on most votes

**Output:**
- Print selected validator and consensus method used
- Include a `console.log` or print explanation of the selection logic

**Goal**: Compare decision-making in various consensus mechanisms
